Wait, looking at the provided solution in context: logic says triangles are congruent or area is equal. Let's re-read the solution logic. Solution says [CDEF] = [CDJ] = 36. Why? Ah, [CDJ] = [CDHF] + [HFJ]. Triangle DEH congruent to JFH. So [HFJ] fills the gap. Effectively Triangle CDJ covers the same area extent. Base of triangle CDJ is NOT CD. Base is likely CJ? No, triangle CDJ. Vertices C, D, J. Wait. If J is far out, height is same. Base is CD. Then Area is 1/2 * Base * Height = 18. Why does solution say 36? Let's check the asy code labels. J is at (30,0), F at (20,0), C at (10,0). So C, F, J are collinear. Base CJ has length 20. Base CF has length 10. Height is 8. Area Parallelogram = Base(CF=10)*Height(8) = 80? Code says 10 to 20 is F. C is 10. D is 12,8. E is 22,8. Base CD is vector (2,8). No, CDEF. Base is on x axis? C(10,0) to F(20,0). Length 10. Height 8. Area 80. Problem says Area 36. Okay, scale doesn't matter. Relation matters. Triangle CDJ. Base CJ = CF + FJ. Triangles DEH and JFH are congruent (ASA). So EH=HF (given) and angles match. So DE = FJ. In parallelogram, CD=EF. EF=2*HF. DE is side. CD=EF. So FJ=CD? No. DE=CF? No. DE=FJ. EF=CD. Base CJ = CF + FJ. Area CDJ = 1/2 * CJ * h = 1/2 * (CF+FJ) * h. Since DE=CF (parallelogram), and DE=FJ (congruent), then CF=FJ.
